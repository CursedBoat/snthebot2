![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1002963217083011134.webp?size=96&quality=lossless)

  

Literally just my old Discord bot, except re-written in Rust.
 

------------

  

### Features

- Rust's guessing game, except now in Discord üëç
- A "say" command that deletes your message after the command is invoked
- A command where you can kill your fellow server members
- Search for a user's top play in Osu!std because no-one plays any other mode 
- Reddit command which returns a random post from the specified subreddit
- Other dumb commands (see [src/commands](https://github.com/CursedBoat/snthebot2/tree/master/src/commands  "src/commands"))

# Building from source

**NOTE: I HAVE NOT TESTED THE PROJECT IN LINUX**

## Prerequisites:

1. Rust & Cargo ([use rustup](https://rustup.rs/  "rustup"))
2. Discord application and bot token (can be created [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications/ "Discord Developer Portal"))
3. Osu! client and client secret (can be created [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/account/edit "Osu!"))
  
## Building the project:

1. Clone and cd into the repo:
``git clone https://github.com/CursedBoat/snthebot2.git``  
``cd snthebot2``

  

2. Modify the `.env` file and enter your Discord token, Osu! client secret and prefix. The file must be in the root directory (e.g. the folder containing src)
**Example:**
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=example
PREFIX=~
OSU_CLIENT_SECRET=example
```

  

3. Build the project:
``cargo build --release``  

4. Run the executable from ``./target/release/snthebot2``
Note: the application will panic if a ``.env`` file containing the required information is not found.
